So I went to this comedy show last night and the comedian was talking about airplane food. He said, you know what's the deal with airline food? It tastes like it was prepared at 30,000 feet by someone who's never seen food before. The audience was cracking up. Then he did this bit about relationships and dating apps. He said matching with someone on a dating app is like ordering food delivery - you're never quite sure what you're gonna get, but you're too lazy to cook so you just hope for the best. That got even bigger laughs. The timing was perfect and the crowd was really into it.
