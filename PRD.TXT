Product Requirements Document: The Validation Mandate
Author: Alex Chen, VP Product
Version: 3.0 (FINAL)
Date: September 4, 2025
Status: NON-NEGOTIABLE - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

1. Mandate Overview
The time for building is over. The time for proving has begun.

Our codebase is a theoretical asset with zero market value until it is deployed and validated against real-world conditions. This document is the four-hour, time-boxed mandate to convert our code from a liability in a private repository into a proven, data-backed asset in a public-facing environment.

This is not an engineering exercise. This is a go-to-market operation. Failure is not an option.

2. Team & Roles
Alex Chen: VP, Product (Accountable for Mission Success)

Kenji Tanaka: Lead, Backend & Infrastructure (Accountable for Deployment & Performance KPIs)

Sofia Rossi: Lead, Frontend & UX (Accountable for User-Facing Interface)

Priya Sharma: Lead, AI & Data Integration (Accountable for API Performance)

Josue Perez: Lead, Security & Compliance (Accountable for Staging Environment Security)

Tina Huang: Lead, Public Validation (Accountable for Narrative & Market Signal)

3. Problem Statement & Mission Objectives
Problem: We have an enterprise-grade architecture with zero real-world data. Our business case is a hypothesis.

Mission: Within four hours, we will move from a state of technical readiness to operational proof. We will answer the following questions with irrefutable data:

Can it deploy? Prove the infrastructure is sound by achieving a live state.

Can it scale? Prove the architecture works by validating performance KPIs under load.

Is it viable? Prove the business model is sound by calculating the real-world cost per job.

4. Phased Execution Plan
The following phases will be executed sequentially. The time allotments are hard limits.

Phase 0: Critical Pre-Flight Fixes (Time Allotment: 15 Minutes)
Objective: Ensure all prerequisites for deployment are met. This is a go/no-go gate for the timed execution.

[PRE-0.1] Install & Configure gcloud CLI: Essential for deployment.

[PRE-0.2] Replace Mock API Keys: Swap placeholders with production OpenAI/Gemini keys.

[PRE-0.3] Fix Project ID Consistency: Ensure alignment between .env files and deployment scripts.

[PRE-0.4] Update Performance Test Target: Modify performance_test.py to target the Cloud Run URL instead of localhost.

[PRE-0.5] Mitigate Cold Starts: Update deployment scripts to set min-instances=2 to avoid a cold start cascade during the load test.



Phase 1: Go-Live (Time Allotment: 30 Minutes)
Objective: Establish a live, public-facing staging environment. This is the Proof of Life.

[DEP-1.1] Execute Deployment: Run ./deploy.sh & ./deploy-worker.sh. Provision all GCP resources (Cloud Run, Redis, GCS).

[DEP-1.2] Configure Live Keys: Purge all mock/test keys. Populate the environment with production-level API keys for OpenAI and Gemini.

[DEP-1.3] Verify URLs: Confirm public accessibility of the FastAPI and React application URLs.

Phase 2: Validation Under Load (Time Allotment: 1 Hour)
Objective: Generate the performance and cost data that will become our core marketing assets.

[VAL-2.1] Execute Load Test: Run performance_test.py against the live staging URL to simulate 100 concurrent uploads.

[VAL-2.2] Generate Performance Report: Document the raw data against our mandated KPIs. This data is not for internal review; it is the source material for our public narrative.

[VAL-2.3] Generate Cost Analysis: Calculate the precise, real-world cost-per-job. This is the proof point for our business model.

Phase 3: Production Hardening (Time Allotment: 2 Hours)
Objective: Transition the validated platform into a secure, monitored, and user-ready service.

[PROD-3.1] Secure Environment: Implement basic API key authentication to lock down the staging environment.

[PROD-3.2] Configure Monitoring: Establish live monitoring dashboards in GCP for API latency, error rates, and worker utilization.

[PROD-3.3] Final UX Polish: Optimize the frontend based on live environment performance.

5. Success Metrics: Public Deliverables
The success of this mandate will be measured by the production of the following public-facing assets. These are not internal reports.

DELIVERABLE 1: The "Proof of Life" Tweet: A public post from Tina Huang with the live staging URL, announcing that the platform is live.

DELIVERABLE 2: The Performance Validation Blog Post: A detailed article titled "How We Built (and Broke) a Scalable AI Service: A Real-Time Performance Teardown." This will feature the P99 latency and success rate data from the load test.

DELIVERABLE 3: The Cost-Analysis Video: A short YouTube video from Tina Huang titled "The Real Cost of Running a Cloud-Native SaaS," breaking down our exact cost-per-job.

6. Public Communication Mandate (Lead: Tina Huang)
The engineering work is the B-roll. The narrative is the A-roll.

Narrative: We are the hyper-transparent team demonstrating a masterclass in cloud architecture and execution. We are showing, not telling, the market how to build a real product.

Content Capture: The entire 4-hour process will be documented. Kenji's terminal during deployment, the GCP dashboards during the load test, Sofia's UX adjustmentsâ€”all of it is content.

Asset Creation: Tina's primary role during this phase is to direct the capture of this content and immediately begin packaging it into the public deliverables defined in Section 5.

This is the plan. There will not be another. Execute.
