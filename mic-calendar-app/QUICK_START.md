# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Your Post-Set Intelligence App is Ready!

### ✅ What's Already Built
- **Vue.js 3 App** with modern component architecture
- **Post-Set Intelligence Modal** with smart parsing
- **Calendar View** for tracking performances
- **Joke Library** for organizing material
- **Stats Dashboard** for performance insights
- **Supabase Backend** ready for database operations

### 🌐 Access Your App
The development server is running at: **http://localhost:3003/**

### 🔧 Next Steps

#### 1. Set Up Supabase (Required for full functionality)
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your project URL and anon key
4. Create `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
5. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor

#### 2. Test the App (Works without Supabase for now)
- Click "Log Set" to see the Post-Set Intelligence modal
- Type in the brain dump area to see intelligent parsing
- Navigate between Calendar, Library, and Stats views

#### 3. Customize
- Edit parsing rules in `src/components/SetLogModal.vue`
- Modify styles in the component files
- Add new features to the views

### 🎯 Key Features to Try

#### Post-Set Intelligence
```
Type this in the brain dump:
"Venue was The Comedy Cellar. Crowd hot. New airplane joke worked but tag needs work. #newmaterial #audition"

Watch it automatically parse:
- Venue: The Comedy Cellar
- Tags: newmaterial, audition
- Performance Date: Today
```

#### Navigation
- **Calendar**: Main view with set history and quick stats
- **Library**: Joke management (currently shows sample data)
- **Stats**: Performance analytics and insights

### 🚨 Current Status
- ✅ Frontend: Complete and functional
- ✅ Components: All built and styled
- ✅ Routing: Working navigation
- ⚠️ Backend: Needs Supabase setup for data persistence
- ⚠️ Authentication: Will be added in next phase

### 🔮 What's Next
1. **Set up Supabase** for real data storage
2. **Add authentication** for user accounts
3. **Implement joke management** with full CRUD
4. **Add advanced parsing** for more intelligent extraction
5. **Deploy to production** (Vercel/Netlify)
